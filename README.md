# Project Title: Data Analysis and Querying of Superstore Orders Using MongoDB and Python

# Overview:

> This assignment demonstrates how to:

1) Connect to MongoDB Atlas using Python

2) Load and insert Superstore dataset from a CSV file into MongoDB

3) Perform various CRUD operations and aggregation queries

4) Use MongoDBâ€™s advanced features like $lookup, $match, $project, etc.

5) Understand theoretical MongoDB concepts (replication, sharding, collections, etc.)

# Theoretical Concepts Covered:

1) Collections vs Documents

2) Replication and High Availability

3) Sharding and Horizontal Scaling

4) Security Mechanisms in MongoDB

5) Aggregation Pipeline and $lookup

6) ACID Transactions and their support

7) SQL vs NoSQL

8) Use Cases of MongoDB in Real-world Apps

9) Benefits of MongoDB Atlas 

# Deliverables:

1) Google Colab with working code

2) Superstore dataset inserted into MongoDB

3) Aggregation and filter queries with outputs

4) Theory answers for MongoDB concepts

5) This README file for documentation
